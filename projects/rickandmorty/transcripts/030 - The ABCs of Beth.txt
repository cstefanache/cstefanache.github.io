NEWS ANCHOR: In local news, child murderer Joseph Eli Lipnip is scheduled to die tomorrow by lethal injection, his execution already drawing dozens more spectators than the death of TV news. Carla?

CARLA JOHNSON: The man that once ate his own son

BETH: Wow. He’s really getting executed after all this time. You know the son that he ate was --

SUMMER: Your best friend -- Tommy. We know. Stop true-crime bragging.

BETH :I was traumatized, Summer. Okay, your generation wouldn’t get that.

SUMMER: Bitch, my generation gets traumatized for breakfast.

BETH: It took years of therapy to even process the reality. I mean, when I was a kid, I just told myself that Tommy had gotten lost in the magical realm of Froopyland.

SUMMER :"Froopyland?"

BETH: My make-believe world. I know the name’s stupid, but it was so real to me.

RICK: Aren’t you guys supposed to be at your father’s for custody weekend?

MORTY :We’re not in a hurry. Dad sleeps until sundown. Can we talk a little bit more about this Froopy--

[ ZAP, BLOOP ]

SUMMER :Not the bubble gun! There’s no air --

[ ZAP, BLOOP ]

BETH :I gotta say, I am warming up to the bubble gun.

RICK: You know, if you’re so great at naming things, why don’t you do it from now on?

BETH :-What?

RICK :-Froopyland. Was it my best work? I don’t know. Does it deserve to be shit on creatively? Yeah, that’s right. I agree with your look of horrified realization. You can be very inconsiderate sometimes.

(CUT TO GARAGE)

RICK :[ Rattling ] [ Grunting ] Here it is. You know, I collapsed a quantum tesseract to

BETH: -- Dad, I don’t care how you made it. I want to know if Tommy’s still in there!

RICK: Relax, Beth. (draws door on wall) [ Jingling, crackling) If he is, we’ll find him. He’ll be the only sun-bleached skeleton with non-imaginary DNA.

(OPENING CREDITS) (FROOPYLAND)

BETH: Tommy! Tommy! This is a nightmare. I can’t believe you used to lock me up in this glorified chicken coop.

RICK: Chicken coop? Those are procedurally generated clouds, Beth. That river is a rainbow. Literally. Come on, I-I-I put real elbow grease into this place.

BETH: Well, you’re supposed to put elbow grease into your daughter!

RICK :Gross.

BETH: Do you think something ate him?

RICK: Nope. Froopyland creatures were designed to be harmless. He definitely just starved to death.

BETH: I could have been the one who starved to death in here. What if I’d gotten hurt?

RICK :God, you’re right. I’m a terrible dad. Well, nothing to live for. Goodbye, cruel world! (jumps off cliff)

BETH: Dad!

RICK :[ Thump ] Oh, how do you like that? What kind of merciless creator makes the ground bouncy? I’m gonna have to drown myself.

BETH: [Jumps, Thump ] Unh!

RICK :(sticks head in water) Oh, no. Oh, the water’s breathable? Who went and did that?

BETH :Oh, whatever.

RICK :Yeah, whatever. A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2, and it breaks the front page of Reddit, but I’m Charles Manson because I gave you your own world instead of an iPad. I think the words you’re looking for are -- Aah! [Gets grabbed by a raptor. Screeches ] Holy [bleep] [Bleep] This thing has claws!

BETH :Yeah, I get it. It’s a childproof world.

RICK: No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad! This thing is sinking razor-sharp claws in -- Aah! [Bleep]

BETH: You’ve made your point, Dad. Dad?

(CUT TO SUMMER AND MORTY IN BUBBLE) [ POP, POP ]

MORTY :Ugh!

[ BOTH PANTING ]

SUMMER: Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing?

MORTY: I think it’s supposed to help prevent abandonment issues.

SUMMER: I want to be abandoned.

MORTY: Yeah, I’m talking about Dad.

JERRY: [ DOOR OPENS ] Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.

SUMMER: Wow, Dad. Your place looks way less like a crackhouse.

MORTY: It’s actually clean, like a cocaine house. Dad, what’s going on?

JERRY: I’m simply centered, activated -- [ GLASS CLINKS, WARBLE ]

MORTY :And telekinetic?

JERRY: Pretty cool, huh? Check it out. Who wants a smoothie? [ RATTLE, BLENDER WHIRRING ] Oh -- Oh, no. Uh, oh, God. Summer -- Summer, can you --

SUMMER :-Aah!

JERRY: -Sorry.

KIARA: [ WARBLE ] You have much to learn, my Uloo.

JERRY: Morty, Summer, this is Kiara. She’s a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon.

MORTY: I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad. Uh, Chaimuntolo.

KIARA: Chaimuntolo, younglings.

SUMMER: Hymencholo.

KIARA: Your father’s mind holds love for you. I am humbled to meet in physicality.

SUMMER: Dad, are you

JERRY :-- In love with a badass, sexy alien lady? Ha, ha, I don’t know, Summer. You tell me.

SUMMER: I wasn’t going to ask if you were in love since you barely know her.

JERRY: Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together. And things just kind of clicked.

KIARA: We must move! Our reservation is at 7:00.

JERRY: [ WHOOSH ] I hate to see her leave, but I love to watch her phase shift away. I’m sure you noticed what she has three of, but guess what she has two of?

(FROOPYLAND)

RICK: [ SCREECHES ] Oof! All right, knock it off! Listen, I’ve been giving you a pass because I’m charmed that life finds a way, but -- Aah! All right, you know what? [ RAY GUN FIRES ] Ouch! Oh! Unh! Ouch! God! [ SIZZLING ] Aah! Agh! [ ARM CLICKS ]

BETH: Oh, yeah, this place is the safest. Best dad ever. Can’t you just say, "I admit it, I screwed up"?

RICK: Uh, what would be the point of that?

BETH: [ CHUCKLING ] You can’t do it, can you? You can’t just [bleep] apologize.

RICK: Okay, okay, Beth, I’m sorry you think you deserve an apology. [RAPTOR SCREECHES ] Hey, don’t look at me. You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target, it’s gonna get stepped on. [RAPTOR SCREECHES, WHIR, ZAP ] Huh. Well, here’s the problem right here. We’ve got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA.

BETH: Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest?

RICK: It’s just a working theory. Of course, if that’s the case, I expect he’d be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children.

(ENTER GROUP OF TOMMY'S OFFSPRING)

LEAD FROOPY CREATURE: Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, helper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life

RICK :-- Yeah, if I could interrupt? We’re way ahead of the reveal here.

BETH: Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.

(CUT TO RESTAURANT)

MORTY: I thought warrior priestesses could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt.

JERRY: Mmm. Thank you, sweetie.

MORTY: I hope it’s not human season.

KIARA: I’m on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human. Your father and I are soul-bonded.

MORTY: Soul-bonded?

SUMMER: Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no?

KIARA: Sniff [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS, WHOOSH, VARRIX ALIEN WAITER REVEAL]

JERRY: Go get him, honey! She’s always hunting. [ CHUCKLES ] She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and that’s why she said the Yelp reviews didn’t matter.

MORTY: Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

JERRY: Uh, gee, Morty, I don’t know. It’s got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom.

SUMMER: Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this is about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom?

JERRY: Every weekend, you two have told me to move on.

SUMMER: Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound.

MORTY: Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond.

JERRY: Why don’t you just say what you really mean? You think it’s cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize she’s got a hot bod like Cheetara in "Thundercats," but you’re grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head. After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race [ VARRIX SCREAMS ] you ended up racist.

KIARA: [ WHOOSH ] Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate.

JERRY: We could take the kids to the water park.

KIARA: We celebrate with a hunt!

JERRY: Ooh. You kids want to hunt?

MORTY: -Yes.

SUMMER: -Yes.

RICK: I’m not kneeling. Suck my [bleep]

TOMMY: Well, hello, all! I am the King of Froopyland, but I go by another name, too.

BETH: We know.

TOMMY: It’s Tommy!

BETH: -We know.

RICK: -We know.

TOMMY: I have lived here since I was a mere child.

BETH: -We know.

RICK: -Got it.

TOMMY: I suppose you’re wondering, how do I sustain myself?

RICK: -Oh, boy.

BETH: -No, we aren’t.

TOMMY: I always find the theater is the best way to clarify things.

BETH: -Ugh.

FROOPY VOICE :Don’t do it!

TINY BETH: This is my secret Froopyland where I have no rules!

LITTLE TOMMY: I am excited.

TINY BETH: I am jealous of Tommy’s friends and his Nintendo and his dad who likes him.

RICK: I take it Tommy wasn’t class playwright.

TINY BETH: You want to see the Honey Swamp?

LITTLE TOMMY: Yes! Let’s do it!

TINY BETH: Well, I want to see you dead.

LITTLE TOMMY: Ow, help! I’m stuck! I’m covered in honey.

RICK: Huh. Well, that’s interesting.

BETH: Fake news.

LITTLE TOMMY: Many nights have passed, trapped in this strange land. I am hungry, and all I can do to pass the time is hump. I will hump this rock. [ TAPPING ] I will hump this tree. [ TAPPING ] I will hump this beast of the land and put my seed in it.[ TAPPING ]

(DRAWS CIRCLE ON FLOOR AND LEAVES FROOPYLAND) (SMITH FAMILY LIVING ROOM)

BETH: What are you doing? We’re in the middle of an adventure.

RICK: Here’s some things an adventure needs, Beth. Conflict, stakes, a way for me to benefit, and, clearly, Morty.

BETH: But Tommy’s still in there, raping Muppets and eating babies.

RICK: Yep. Luckily, that’s not our problem. Time to pull the plug.

BETH: Pull the plug? We have to get Tommy out of there, okay? We -- We need to do the right thing. Do what you never did as a dad -- Put in a little effort.

RICK: All right, cut the high-road routine. We both saw Tommy’s shitty play. You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth. His very happy life is in your hands. You go save him from it.

BETH: [ SCOFFS ] You’re gonna believe a play over your own daughter?

RICK: Yes, I am, Beth, because you’re not my own daughter.

BETH: Oh, God, yes. I’m one of infinite Beths with infinite fathers in infinite universes. It’s called a hug, Dad. It won’t kill you.

RICK: Yeah, don’t be so sure. You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland for all their little girls? Same reason I wasn’t surprised by Tommy’s overwritten, badly structured, cheaply produced flashback. You were a scary [bleep] kid, man.

BETH: [ SCOFFING ] Oh, my God.

RICK: I didn’t make Froopyland to get rid of you, Beth. I did it to protect the neighborhood. Not in a [burps] noble sense. It was just more practical to sequester you before I had to start, you know, cloning a replacement for every less-than-polite little boy or gullible animal that might cross your socio-path.

BETH: You would rather believe I’m evil than admit that you were a bad father?

RICK: Oh, dude, no. No, bad father all the way to the max over here. I’m a [bleep] nutcase. And the acorn plopped straight down, baby. Look at some of this shit you were asking me to make you as a kid. Ray guns. A whip that forces people to like you. Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap, a lightning gun, a teddy bear with anatomically correct innards, night-vision googly-eye glasses, sound-erasing sneakers, false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts, a lie-detecting doll, an indestructible baseball bat, a Taser shaped like a ladybug, a fake police badge, location-tracking stickers (time = 10:55 -5.243, 47.394, rainbow-colored duct tape, mind-control hair clips, poison gum, a pink, sentient switchblade.

PINK SENTIENT SWITCHBLADE: Hi, Beth, you’ve gotten taller. Shall we resume stabbing?

BETH: Has it occurred to you that I asked you to make those things because I wanted you to spend time with me? Has it occurred to you that if I did try killing Tommy, it might be because I was jealous of his family?

RICK: Wait, what? Why? Wasn’t his dad, like, some kind of cannibal? Seems like it must be hereditary.

BETH: Oh, my God. This is your fault. I am not a bad person. I’m gonna go back in there, I’m getting Tommy, and I’m fixing this!

TOMMY: So, then, it should be pretty easy to say, "Sorry I pushed you."

BETH: Real easy and not necessary, since you coming home will save your dad’s life whereas nothing is changed by anyone stroking your batshit-crazy ego.

TOMMY: Sorry, forgive me. Uh, I’ve been in Froopyland for quite a while. Have apologies changed?

BETH: I am wiped out. I guess I’ll turn in.

RICK: Cool.

BETH: Dad? I feel like I’ve spent my life pretending you’re a great guy and trying to be like you. And the ugly truth has always been

RICK: -- That I’m not that great a guy and you’re exactly like me.

BETH: Am I evil?

RICK: Worse. You’re smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I’ve never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy.

BETH: Tommy.

RICK: Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it’ll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There’s no other way off.

BETH: Dad, I’m out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do?

RICK: My advice -- Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.

BETH: I can’t do that. The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC’s "The Bachelor."

RICK: I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. It’ll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone’s job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going "Blade Runner."

BETH: If nothing matters, why would you do that for me?

RICK: I don’t know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don’t jump a gift shark in the mouth.

BETH: I don’t know if I can do it.

RICK: Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you’ve chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose, you’re finally gonna chill the [bleep] out.
