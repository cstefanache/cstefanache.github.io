JERRY: What’s new at school?

SUMMER: Nothing.

MORTY: Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died. They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her.

BETH: Good lord! Who does something like that?

RICK: Obviously a vampire. W-w-where’s the pepper?

SUMMER: Wait, what?! Vampires are real?!

JERRY: Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew?

RICK: Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now.

MORTY: Yeah, Summer, it’s a big universe.

MORTY: Get used to it. R-right, Rick?

SUMMER: Well, what are we going to do?!

RICK: We’re gonna live our lives until we die. Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire.

SUMMER: Grandpa Rick, couldn’t you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down?

MORTY: Um -- wow.

RICK: Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer. I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school. But here’s my reverse-ask -- why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that And why aren’t you more ashamed of yourself?

SUMMER: Dad!

JERRY: Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.

BETH: Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter?

JERRY: Sor-ry! I wasn’t paying attention.

BETH: To a conversation about vampires?!

JERRY: Clearly, I didn’t know it was about vampires, because I wasn’t paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me!

BETH: Oh, here we go, right to the victim role.

JERRY: Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?!

RICK: Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already?

JERRY: Well, we tried a couples’ therapist.

RICK: That’s earth therapy. You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round. I mean, he’ll try his best, but mostly, he’s just gonna get horrified. I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate.

BETH: Well, we want to make it work, if we can.

JERRY: It’s just -- then it’s settled.

RICK: No need to pack.

JERRY: Oh!

RICK: Let’s go, go, go, go!
