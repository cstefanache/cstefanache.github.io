Morty:  I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.

Rick:  I agree, Morty. [ Belches ] It’s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.

Morty:  Ohh!

Rick:  Relax. That’s what windshields are for.

Morty:  I didn’t know that there were bugs out in space.

Rick:  Well, w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this.

Morty:  Geez, Rick, that’s disgusting. I don’t want to look at that.

Rick:  Yeah, guess I’m out of fluid. L-let me find a place to stop. Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?

Farmer:  The general store ought to have what you need.

Rick:  Thanks.

Farmer:  Of course, you’ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.

Rick:  Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?

Farmer:  Sundown is when the festival begins.

Morty:  The festival?

Farmer:  Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace.

Rick:  Oh, I know what this is! You’ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.

Farmer:  That’s right.

Morty:  What?!

Rick:  It’s like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"?

Farmer:  Oh, have you been here before?

Rick:  No, no, but I’ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it’s called the cleansing or the red time. There was this one world that called it just murder night. I-it’s a purge planet. They’re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.

Morty:  T-that’s horrible!

Rick:  Yeah. You want to check it out?

THEME MUSIC♪ [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ]

Rick:  SO, WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THE FESTIVAL? YOU LOCK YOURSELF IN, OR YOU GO OUT AND DO SOME STUFF?

General Store Owner:  OH, I DO SOME PRETTY BAD STUFF.

Rick:  OH, I BET YOU DO, OLD TIMER. [ LAUGHS ]

Morty:  GEE... RICK, COME ON. THE SUN IS SETTING. W-WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

Rick:  ALL RIGHT, WELL, W-WHAT DO I OWE YOU FOR THE WIPER FLUID?

General Store Owner:  IT’S ON THE HOUSE. OH, AND, UH, WHY... WHY DON’T YOU HAVE SOME CANDY BARS, AS WELL?

Rick:  OH, NO WAY. THAT’S REALLY NICE OF YOU.

General Store Owner:  I’M A NICE GUY... FOR NOW.

Rick:  [ CHUCKLING ] OHH, I DON’T DOUBT IT.

Morty:  RICK!

Rick:  YEAH, YEAH. HEY, HAVE A GOOD FESTIVAL, OLD TIMER.

General Store Owner:  I INTEND TO.

Morty:  RICK, UNLOCK IT!

Rick:  JUST A SECOND, MORTY. OH, LOOK AT THAT SUNSET.

Morty:  STOP SCREWING AROUND.

[ CLICK ]

Rick:  THERE WE GO. MUCH BETTER. NOW WE CAN SEE.

Morty:  GREAT.

Rick:  HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MORTY? WHY DON’T WE CHRISTEN OUR SQUEAKY-CLEAN WINDSHIELD HERE BY WATCHING A LITTLE OF THIS PURGE THROUGH IT?

Morty:  WHAT?! NO! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

Rick:  MORTY, GROW UP. IF YOU DON’T WANT TO WATCH, DON’T WATCH, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT’S MY CAR. [ BELCHES ] ALSO, IF YOU TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS, I’LL PURGE YOU.

Morty:  YOU’RE THE WORST. AND THIS PLANET IS THE WORST. HOW CAN YOU BE INTO THIS? YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GONNA KILL EACH OTHER.

Rick:  SO, WHAT, Y-Y-YOU TRYING TO SIT HERE AND TELL ME THAT [BELCHES] I-IF... IF THERE’S A VIDEO ONLINE WITH SOMEONE GETTING DECAPITATED, YOU DON’T CLICK ON IT?

Morty:  NO! WHY... WHY WOULD I DO THAT? YOU DO THAT?

Rick:  I DON’T, BECAUSE IT WOULD BORE ME. I SEE SHIT LIKE THAT FOR BREAKFAST, MORTY. BUT IF YOU DON’T DO IT, I SAY IT’S BECAUSE YOU’RE AFRAID OF YOUR OWN PRIMAL INSTINCTS. SO YOU STUFF THEM DOWN AND... [ BELL CHIMING ] OH, OH! SHH. SHH. IT’S STARTING. OH-HO-HO! HERE WE GO.

Morty:  I’M NOT WATCHING.

Rick:  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YOUR MEDAL’S IN THE MAIL. I’M GONNA GET A CLOSER LOOK.

Morty:  OH, OKAY, SURE. AND THEN SOMEONE’S GONNA THROW A ROCK AND HIT THE CAR AND THEN WE’RE GONNA CRASH AND WE’RE GONNA BE STUCK DOWN THERE AND IT’S GONNA BE WHAT WE DESERVE.

Rick:  YAWN. WHOA! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] WHOA, THEY ARE PURGING THE F[BLEEP] OUT OF EACH OTHER. [ MUFFLED SCREAMING ] OH, MY GOD! OH [BLEEP] THAT WAS... OKAY, YEAH. T-THAT WAS GROSS. WOW.

Rick:  ALL RIGHT, MORTY. L-LET’S GET OUT OF HERE.

Morty:  WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HOLD ON. W-WE HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE.

Rick:  [ BELCHING ] WHAT? WHY?

Morty:  THAT POOR GIRL. W-WE HAVE TO SAVE HER.

Rick:  UH, MORTY, IN SPACE, WE HAVE SOMETHING WE CALL THE NON-INTERFERENCE POLICY. WE GOT THE WIPER FLUID. WE WATCHED THEM KILL EACH OTHER. WE’RE LEAVING.

Morty:  HELP ME SAVE THAT GIRL, OR I’M TELLING MOM YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

Rick:  YOU LITTLE TURD. [ SCREAMING ]

Arthirisha:  PLEASE! LEAVE ME ALONE!

MAN LEAVE YOU ALONE? DURING A PURGE?

MAN I DON’T THINK SO, BABY.

Morty:  IT’S OKAY. WE’RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU. MY NAME IS MORTY. THIS IS MY GRANDPA. WE’RE TOURISTS.

Rick:  NOT ANYMORE. AAH! AAH! OH, MY GOD. THIS IS [BLEEP] AWESOME! MORTY, THIS IS REALLY COOL. HEY, Y-YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT HERE AND KILL SOME PEOPLE? IT’S FUN. WE’RE TOTALLY JUSTIFIED BECAUSE WE’RE SAVING A LITTLE GIRL. I MEAN, W-W-WE’RE BOTH FREE AND CLEAR TO MURDER THESE PEOPLE.

Morty:  ARE YOU OKAY?

Arthirisha:  YES. I HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO HIDE.

Morty:  WELL, YOU CAN HIDE WITH US. RICK?

Rick:  YEAH?

Morty:  DO YOU THINK WE COULD TAKE... W-WHAT’S YOUR NAME?

Arthirisha:  ARTHRISHA.

Morty:  COULD WE TAKE ARTHRISHA UP IN THE SHIP AND, YOU KNOW, JUST WAIT OUT THE PURGE?

Rick:  OH, MORTY, HOW CAN I REFUSE AFTER ALL YOU’VE DONE TO BLACKMAIL ME?

Arthirisha:  YOUR VEHICLE... IS IT FROM THE GODS?

Morty:  NO.

Rick:  YES.

Morty:  SO, UH, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE PURGE STARTED, DID PEOPLE GET INTO IT RIGHT AWAY, OR WERE THEY LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT?" THIS IS GONNA STOP CRIME HOW, EXACTLY?"

Arthirisha:  YEAH, IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IT.

Morty:  YEAH, I BET. [ CHUCKLES ] I BET. YEAH, IT’S KIND OF LIKE CELLPHONES, YOU KNOW? AT FIRST, EVERYONE WAS LIKE, "LOOK AT THOSE DOUCHEBAGS PURGING," AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY’RE LIKE, "IT’S JUST SO CONVENIENT."

Rick:  GEEZ, YOU WORKING ON YOUR TIGHT FIVE FOR THE COMEDY STORE, MORTY?

Jerry:  JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.

Summer:  ARE YOU? WHAT PART OF THAT GIVES ME ANYTHING TO WORK WITH?

Summer:  MY CHOICE IS TO SAY NOTHING, BE SARCASTIC, OR BARK "YES" LIKE A TRAINED ANIMAL. IT’S NOT A CONVERSATION. YOU’RE HOLDING ME VERBALLY HOSTAGE.

Morty:  OH, GEEZ, GEEZ! WAIT A MINUTE, RICK. WHY DON’T WE JUST USE YOUR PORTAL GUN?

Rick:  IT’S IN THE CAR, DIP-ASS. [ GRUNTS ] OH, GOD, IT HURTS. SHE GOT ME RIGHT IN THE GODDAMN LIVER, MORTY. IT’S THE HARDEST-WORKING LIVER IN THE GALAXY, MORTY, AND NOW IT HAS A HOLE IN IT. I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT.

Morty:  I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO RIGHT.

Rick:  YEAH, WELL, THAT’S NOT REALLY THE THEME OF TONIGHT’S PARTY. HEADS UP. RAPISTS. WELL, DON’T JUST STAND THERE, MORTY. PURGE ‘EM.

Morty:  ME?

Rick:  NO, ME. SHOULD I RUB MY LIVER HOLE ON THEM? PICK UP A STICK OR SOMETHING AND KILL THEM.

Morty:  UM, W-WE COME IN PEACE.

Morty:  I’M SORRY.

Rick:  THERE’S A PILE OF SILVERWARE NEXT TO YOU, AND YOU THROW ME THE ONE THING THAT CAN NEVER KILL ANYTHING?

Morty:  ALL RIGHT, OKAY!

Rick:  SUMMER, ON THE SHELF ABOVE MY WORKBENCH IN THE GARAGE, THERE’S A RED BOX WITH A KEYPAD ON IT. YOU’RE GONNA TAKE THAT BOX OUTSIDE, AND YOU’RE GONNA TYPE THE NUMBER I JUST GAVE YOU INTO THE KEYPAD. GOT IT?

Summer:  GOT IT. IS IT JUST PART OF GROWING UP TO HATE YOUR DAD?

Rick:  I’M IGNORING YOU. MORTY, IF I CAN GET TO THE TOP OF THAT LIGHTHOUSE, I CAN SEND THE BEACON, AND YOUR SISTER CAN LAUNCH OUR PACKAGE. JUST REMEMBER, IF THERE’S PEOPLE IN THERE AND THEY TRY TO PURGE US, WE GOT TO PURGE THEM FIRST.

Morty:  WE’RE NOT PURGING ANYONE, RICK, ALL RIGHT? W-WILL YOU STOP IT?

Rick:  MORTY, IF WE’RE GONNA SURVIVE TONIGHT, YOU’RE GONNA NEED TO HARNESS YOUR REPRESSED RAGE.

Morty:  I DON’T HAVE ANY!

Lighthouse Keeper:  I TAKE NO PART IN THE FESTIVAL. IF YOU DESIRE TO KILL ME, I ONLY ASK YOU DO IT QUICKLY.

Rick:  NO SUCH AGENDA, CHIEF.

Morty:  WE’RE NOT TOO KEEN ON THE PURGE, EITHER, SIR. WE WERE JUST HOPING TO GET ON THE ROOF OF YOUR LIGHTHOUSE SO WE CAN SEND A BEACON TO MY SISTER ON EARTH. IT’S A DIFFERENT PLANET.

Rick:  BY THE WAY, LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS EXISTS. DON’T LET IT DISTRACT YOU.

Lighthouse Keeper:  I’LL LET YOU USE MY LIGHTHOUSE FOR SHELTER AND BEACON-SENDING ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU LISTEN TO MY TALE.

Morty:  OKAY.

Rick:  DEAL. ALL RIGHT, I’M GONNA GO TO THE ROOF AND SET THINGS UP. MORTY, YOU LISTEN TO HIS TALE.

Morty:  OKAY.

Lighthouse Keeper:  DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS? NOTES?

Morty:  NO. I-I JUST ENJOYED IT. THAT’S MY NOTE, YOU KNOW? PLEASE WRITE MORE.

Lighthouse Keeper:  SEEMS A LITTLE INSINCERE.

Morty:  WHAT? NO.

Lighthouse Keeper:  YOU DON’T HAVE TO MOLLYCODDLE ME. I WANT TO IMPROVE MY WRITING. TELL ME YOUR REAL THOUGHTS.

Morty:  ALL RIGHT. WELL, UM, I’M NOT A HUGE FAN, PERSONALLY, OF THE WHOLE "THREE WEEKS EARLIER" TEASER THING. I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD START OUR STORIES WHERE THEY BEGIN NOT START THEM WHERE THEY GET INTEREST...

Lighthouse Keeper:  GET OUT.

Morty:  UM, WHAT?

Lighthouse Keeper:  NO, I’M SICK OF THIS. YOU BANG ON MY DOOR, YOU BEG ME TO HELP YOU, I SHARE SOMETHING PERSONAL WITH YOU, AND YOU TAKE A GIANT SH1T ON IT.

Morty:  HEY, MAN, WE ASKED IF WE COULD PUT UP A BEACON...

Lighthouse Keeper:  WELL, YOU CAN’T. I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE. YOU’RE A PETTY PERSON, AND YOU’RE INSECURE, AND YOU’RE TAKING IT OUT ON ME. THAT’S A GOOD SCRIPT.

Morty:  WHAT THE HELL?!

Lighthouse Keeper:  I DON’T CARE. I WANT YOU OUT.

Rick:  WHAT?

Lighthouse Keeper:  TAKE THAT THING DOWN. YOUR GRANDSON IS A SHITTY PERSON. LEAVE NOW.

Rick:  MORTY!

Morty:  RICK, I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING. I SAT THROUGH HIS ENTIRE SCREENPLAY...

Lighthouse Keeper:  YOU "SAT THROUGH IT"?

Morty:  YES! DID YOU WANT ME TO WEEP WITH JOY? IT’S TERRIBLE!

Rick:  WHOA! MORTY! WE’RE GUESTS HERE.

Morty:  I TRIED TO BE A GOOD GUEST! HE DRAGGED IT OUT OF ME!

Lighthouse Keeper:  I’M TAKING DOWN THIS BEACON.

Morty:  NO, STOP! THAT’S NOT FAIR! JUST BECAUSE YOU HATE YOUR OWN WRITING DOESN’T MAKE ME A BAD PERSON!

Lighthouse Keeper:  AAH!

Morty:  YOU LIKE THAT? YOU WANT ME TO CUT TO THREE WEEKS EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE?

Rick:  WHOA, MORTY. YOU JUST PURGED. [BEACON ARRIVING. DEVICE BEEPS ] OKAY, TIME TO GO.

Summer:  [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH.

Jerry:  REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO GO TO THE PLAYGROUND, AND I’D PUSH YOU ON THE SWINGS?

Summer:  OH, YOU COULD PUSH ME HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHER KIDS.

Jerry:  YOU WERE SO SMALL AND CUTE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA FLY RIGHT OFF INTO THE STREET.

Summer:  [ CHUCKLING ] I USED TO PEE MY PANTS.

Jerry:  I KNOW, AND NOW LOOK AT YOU! YOU HAVE A JOB. YOU’RE MAKING REALLY GOOD MONEY. YOU’RE NOT PAYING ANY RENT, SO YOU HAVE PLENTY OF DISPOSABLE INCOME.

Summer:  OH, GOD, DAD. PLEASE, DON’T.
