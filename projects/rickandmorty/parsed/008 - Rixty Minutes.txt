rick: well if it's any consolation, summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.

[disconnects and drops cable box, which breaks upon impact to the floor]
jerry: hey!
morty: oh, cool! is that crystallized zanthonite? it conducts electrons across dimensions.
rick: [working on the cable box] 20% accurate, as usual, [snatching the remote from morty] morty. [reconnecting the cable box as the tv buffers] the important thing being i just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.
jerry: wait, does that mean we get showtime extreme?
rick: how about showtime extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? [turns on tv]
corn man 1 (on tv): we're not so different. we're both corn of action.
corn man 2 (on tv): yeah... but one of us is dead corn! [shoots corn man 1]
summer: boring.
rick: summer, [belch] you just spent [belch] three months watching a man choose a fake wife.
jerry: so, what, it'd be better if the people were corn?
rick: jerry, you don't get it. this is infinite tv, from infinite universes. look. [changes channel]

host in trenchcoat (on tv): and now, another quick mystery.
cop (on tv): i just want to know who could've done something like this. it's a travesty!

host in trenchcoat (on tv): wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?
rick: now who wants to watch random, crazy tv shows from different dimensions a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?
beth, summer, and jerry [all at once]: narcissism. the narcisstic stuff. i want to obsess about myself.
rick: [sighs] here. [stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat] these scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. [throws the device into the kitchen] go fetch!
[jerry, summer, and beth run to the kitchen] beth and summer [at the same time]yes! this is so cool! ladies first!
rick: i'm proud of you, morty.
morty: hey man, i don't give a crap about myself, rick. let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!
ants-in-my-eyes johnson (on tv): i'm ants-in-my-eyes johnson, here at ants-in-my-eyes johnson's electronics. i mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! and there's so many tvs, microwaves, radios i think, i can't-- i'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because i can't see anything. our prices, i hope, aren't too low! check out this refrigerator! only $200! what about this microwave? only $100! that's fair! i'm ants-in-my-eyes johnson! everything's black, i can't see a thing! [set on fire] and also i can't feel anything either-- did i mention that? but that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. so that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. i can't feel. it's a very rare disease. all my-- all my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. so i never know what's going on. am i standing? sitting? i don't know.
int. smith residence. jerry, beth, and summer are in the kitchen with the ocular device.
beth: are we sure we want to do this? look at our own alternate lives?

 you're right. maybe we should just play yahtzee--
[grabs the device] give me those! [turns switch]
beth:
 what do you see?
jerry:
 whiteness... pure whiteness.
johnny depp (on device):
 you're my best friend, jerry smith. i love doing cocaine with you.
jerry:
 whoa! i love doing cocaine with you too, johnny depp!
beth:
 [sighs, taking the device] haven't we spent enough time on you?
[turns switch] i'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!
jerry:
 that's great, beth! you always wanted to be a real surgeon.
beth [taking off device]
 i am a real surgeon.
jerry:
 ahh, uh-- summer's turn! [giving summer the device]
summer:
 finally! i don't see anything.
beth:
 well, you should select a different timeline, i mean, if your father and i achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born-- that came out wrong, that came out very wrong.
summer:
 fine, i'll find a world where you bothered to have me. [turns switch a few times] we're playing yahtzee.
beth:
 yahtzee's fun. we love yahtzee.
jerry:
 it's a fun game for fun families! hey, could i get those goggles back for a second?

announcer (on tv):
 it's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of mr.
sneezy 3d. it's the brand-new sneezy xl. the horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. [car sneezes] it's polite, it's right, and it's sneezy deezy mc deluxe.
mr. sneezy 3d (on tv):
 oh, i'm mr. sneezy! achoo!
morty:
 huh, seems like tv from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.
rick:
 yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. [changes channel]
announcer (on tv):
 it's in theaters now! coming this summer: two brothers. in a van. and then a meteor hit. and they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. and then a giant tornado came and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear.
a mexican armada shows up. with weapons made from two--tomatoes. and you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business. in: alien invasion tomato monster mexican armada brothers, who are just regular brothers, running in a van from an asteroid and all sorts of things the movie! hold on, there's more! old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross attack these two brothers. but let's get back to the brothers, because they're-- they have a strong bond. you don't want to know about it here, but i'll tell you one thing: the moon it comes crashing into earth. and what do you do then? it's two brothers and--and th-they're it's called two brothers. two brothers!

[turns switch] i'm taming a lion! no, wait, uhh there are film cameras. i might be a lion-tamer in a movie. [gives summer the device] you get the idea. i work with lions.
summer [turning switch]:
 [dryly] ooh, we're not playing yahtzee, [shoves device into jerry's hands] we're playing chutes and ladders. it seems like when i exist, life gets a little more, i don't know, predictable?
beth:
 when two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.
jerry:
 gimme a break! we're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.
beth:
 oh, i get it. now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.
jerry:
 well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!
beth:
 [scoffs] what are you talking about?
jerry:
 all this time, you've been thinking, "what if that loser jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"
summer:
 um--
jerry:
 well now you know: you'd be a doctor. [circles finger] whoop-dee-doo. you'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. and i'd be on dicaprio's yacht-- [holds up device] banging kristen stewart!
summer:
 you thought about getting an abortion?
beth:
 everyone thinks about it. obviously, i'm the version of me that didn't do it. so you're welcome.
jerry:
 yeah, you're welcome.
summer:
 yeah, thank you guys so much. it's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.
rick [walking to the cupboard]:
 hey, do we have any wafer cookies? [grabs cookie box. eats cooke and starts walking away] mm! [stops and looks back at jerry, summer and beth] oh, boy. looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? that's too bad. you know, me and morty are having a blast, we just discovered a show called "ball fondlers". i mean, i don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. [eats another cookie, walking offscreen]
int. smith residence. rick and morty are sitting in the living room watching tv.

jerry:
 that show "ball fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.
summer:
 dad!
jerry:
 what? they're having fun in there! what do you guys want from me? every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.
summer:
 we'll i'm leaving!
beth:
 you can't leave, you're 17!
summer:

morty:
 oh, okay, was his name lorenzo music?
rick:
 yeah, i'm pretty sure. he also did that voice of that one guy from ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character bill murray played in the movie. but then, when they made the movie bill murray did the voice of gazorpazorp-- or garfield, i mean.
morty:
 yeah, that's pretty cool, rick. so all that happened in this reality too?

 which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.
beth:
