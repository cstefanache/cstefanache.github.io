                Hi, I'm Cornel Stefanache. I author this blog, code for living, code for fun and do research in
                evolutionary computation. I love to train people and do public speeches. I am a huge fan of javascript
                technologies and try to contribute as much as possible to the community.

            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/readthesource/videos">readthesource</a> - is a live developer
                Hangout on Air) where we invite Open Source project committers and/or maintainers to come on the show
                and walk us through their code. Sometimes the code is a small piece of the codebase and sometimes (but
                rarely) the whole project. Give it a try, we have: Zone.js (Mi≈°ko Hevery), React Redux (Dan Abramov),
                Lazy.js (Daniel Tao) and many more.

                Checkout my starter pack for a web <a href="https://github.com/cstefanache/evolutionary-computation">Evolutionary
                Computation</a> library.
                This project will have to sum up 7 years of study in artificial intelligence, evolutionary algorithms
                and artificial life that I did for my PhD. Unfortunately, free time is my worst enemy at the moment.
                My plan is to gather all types of algorithms within the library and try to use them for:
                code generation, various optimisations and why not: artificial life.
